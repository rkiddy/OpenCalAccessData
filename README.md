The California Secretary of State makes a raw dump of data about campaign finances and lobbying activity available for download at:

http://www.sos.ca.gov/prd/cal-access/

The zip file at http://campaignfinance.cdn.sos.ca.gov/dbwebexport.zip contains two zip files, one with a "doc_" prefix and the other with a "db_" prefix. The doc file has not changed since I have been tracking this (2013/10/28). The db file changes every day, but I am not sure what time it gets updated, if there is a regular time. The SoS also does not publish a digest value, so one cannot verify the integrity of the download, or timestamp the file in any visible way. And the SoS offically provides no support for anything done with this data.

As a matter of fact, the SoS cannot correct anything in the data. The data is filed as it is filed and is a legal document. Because the system that accepts on-line submissions does not seem to do any data validation before accepting the data, a lot of stuff has been accepted.

And, if the SoS keeps track of errors reported in the data, they do not let anyone in the public know of it. They will hear you if you report something and thank you for the information, but there is nothing that they will do about it. Or, if there is, there is nothing they will be able to tell you about what they can do.

So, if someone says they live in "Oatland, CA", or say they have a 2 digit phone number, there is nothing the SoS can do about it.

But we, as members of the public, can see this data and I can set up a system to track errors in the data and keep track of how to correct the errors. I have no authorization to correct the data, but when I have the data, it is no longer a legal record of the data, but my copy of the legal record, to do with as I will. So, I will. And I will not claim that this data is the legal record, so that is all good.

If you have any suggestions about any of this, please contact me at:
